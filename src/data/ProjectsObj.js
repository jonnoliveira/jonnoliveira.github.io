It's possible to describe each expense in detail and even edit or delete each one individually. I used React, Redux and JavaScript to carry out all the project's programming logic, asynchronous requests to obtain economic data, HTML and CSS for structuring and styling, and RTL tests to assess the good behavior of the application.

    description: "In this project I performed automated tests using the React Testing Library. Using Stryker I was able to verify the consistency of the tests created when they were able to detect the purposeful changes, or mutants, created in the application. Good tests help us avoid bugs in the application, ensuring that it works properly. Another benefit is being able to refactor the code with confidence that the behavior doesn't change.
